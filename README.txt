LoudounCodes Searching and Sorting in Java

Computer Science AP Supplimental Material


This material was created during the Covid-19 crisis of 2020 for Loudoun County, VA.  Our classes abruptly went into a distance learning mode, with this material still left to be covered before the AP exam.  In these folders are example java code that shows example of searching and sorting, with some questions, videos, and exercises for you to do on your own.

Each file is filled with comments, questions, and references to other matrial online to look at.  If you can, get in a group of students who are also working through the material and discuss the questions.

This material is meant to be used in the following order:


Searching - 

LinearSearch.java
First, look at and understand the LinearSearch.java file.  Here, we have 100 integers and need to find the index of a given integer.

binary/SearchDriver.java
Next, go look at the SearchDriver.java file in the 'binary' directory.  This driver lets us switch between two different implementations.  Notice that in this example the data is sorted.  We'll talk about how to get sorted data later on... for now, lets just take it for granted that we can sort data.

In the first use of SearchDriver,  we use the BinarySearcher.java file to perform a 'binary search' over the sorted data. The file is full of comments that explain what's going on.

In the second use of SearchDriver, we use the RecursiveBunarySearcher.java file which performs the same algorithm, but does so recursively.  Again, chock full of comments.


Sorting -

Sorting is a big deal in computer science.  Start with the Sorting1.java example.  Here, we lean on the built-in 'sort' method the Java Class Libraries gives us.

Sorting2.java implements a 'bubble search'.  It also has a ton of references to videos to watch that demonstrates other videos.

Sorting3.java - There is no Sorting3.java... it's up to you to make one based on an algorithm you saw in those videos.
